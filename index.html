  <p>Artificial intelligence needs no introduction. Every article related to technology, we read on the web, emphasizes the need for AI and how it would be the next thing of the web. A number of companies and organizations are already implementing AI for their needs. Some have been reaping the benefits of AI for their businesses. A simple definition of AI should be the intelligence displayed by machines as opposed to human intelligence.
  
  One of the latest introductions in the field of AI is the grid, which makes web development a simple process and initiates development based on the content. There are no templates or coding – all you have to do is provide instructions, and it will lay out what you want. It implements AI to make this process easier. So now, the time has come for a web developer to be an AI web developer, who knows better about the future wherein web development is more inclined toward giving the consumers what they need and not just giving them what the developer is capable of creating.
  
  AI should be on your list if you are looking for what capabilities or skills would add to making you a hit professional in web development.</p>

  <section id="VR"> <h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
  <img src="https://cdn.acodez.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Virtual-reality.jpg" width="300 px" height="100px">
  <p>Some of the MNCs and giants, such as Google and Microsoft, are already implementing virtual reality or web VR. Virtual reality can be simply defined as the process of implementing computer technology to create a stimulating environment. VR is capable of placing users within an experience, which cannot be observed in any of the existing traditional interfaces. Rather than accessing a screen that is placed in front of them, users can engage and interact with the 3D world in real time.
  
  What more do they need? A web developer should start thinking and working to incorporate VR abilities in their scope. This would include taking up responsibilities involving the research, evaluation, implementation and testing new and innovative methodologies of the emerging VR within the web experience that they are developing.
  
  As we already discussed, people are looking for a real-world experience, which could be challenging to provide unless there is VR in it. You can start considering learning Unity 3D or Unreal if you are up for it. C# and C++ are also part of the skillsets that you would need when transitioning into a VR developer as part of your job quest as a web developer.

   <section id="TOT"><h4>Internet of things(IoT)</h4>
  <img src="https://cdn.acodez.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Internet-of-things-IoT.jpg" width="300px" height="100px">
  <p>According to the definition of the IoT, it is a computing concept that brings forth the idea of connecting everyday physical objects with the internet and making it easier to identify these with other devices. It might include other technologies, such as wireless technologies, QR codes and sensor technologies.
  
  Any object that can represent itself digitally becomes something greater or bigger than the said object. This object is now not only connected to its user but a lot more things – such as the surrounding objects and database data.
  
  It would involve a connection between applications and physical devices, which will need the developers to be flexible. As a team or as an individual, the IoT developer needs to exhibit a wide range of skills, including software programming, hardware programming, networking, systems engineering and UI/UX, mobile app development, machine learning and a knowledge of tools, such as Arduino, Eclipse IoT, IBM Watson IoT, IFTTT and Zetta.
  If you think you have all these skills, then you are moving toward securing a better job with higher pay as a web developer.</p>
